# YOLO3_object_detection

This is a Colab Notebook showing a simple example of object detection using the Hungarian algorithm and YOLO v3 algorithm implemented with Open CV. At present, it is in Polish, I will translate it into English when I manage to get around to doing it. :)

# Before running the notebook:
Create a directory called YOLO.
Download the YOLOv3 pretrained weights from [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights), the model config file from [here](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg) and the COCO labels from [here](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names). Save these files in that directory. Alternatively, you can update the paths to these files in the notebook, should you choose to save them elsewhere.
